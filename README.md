<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f10aab5e-732b-4901-8a9b-41dcac68cbb3" width="500">

Device that I created for my job as a calibration technician for our CDI torque measurement machine. Typically we would write out by hand our readings and then sum/average them, but this device does that automatically for us, saving time and lessening chance of math typing error.

Buttons:
A - display average of readings stored so far
B - display current sum of readings stored so far
X - Delete one, currently selected reading
Y - Delete all stored readings
